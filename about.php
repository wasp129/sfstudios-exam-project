				“For me the movies are like a machine that generates empathy. It lets you understand a little bit more about different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us." <span style="color: #df134c; font-size: 20px;">- Roger Ebert</span><br><br>
			</p>	
			<p>
				The late great Roger Ebert said those words at a press conference, just before he died. And like him, we at SF Studios believe that movies are powerful. Not just because they can be great fun, moving or inspirational. But because they are tools with which we can gain a better understanding of the world surrounding us. And so, we are more than 60 dedicated movie-lovers who work every day to bring films and entertainment to everyone. <br><br>

				Established in 1999 as the danish branch of the swedish “Svensk Filmindustri”, one of the legendary Scandinavian production-houses, SF-Studios started as a one-man team in the attic of an industrial building on the “Nordhavn” harbor on Østerbro. Through hard work, dedication and a love of films things started to quickly take off. In the years following, SF-Studios experienced massive growth and quickly became the single biggest movie-distributor in Denmark and Scandinavia.</p> <br><br>

				But our aspirations did not stop there. By the mid-2000’s, SF-Studios established SF Productions, a subsidiary responsible for the actual production of Scandinavian movies. Through time, we have accumulated a portfolio of some of the most critically acclaimed and award winning film-productions in Scandinavian history. 
 
				A lot has changed since then. The industry has changed, movies have changed, people have changed, we have changed. But our mission remains the same; to deliver high quality, engaging, magical and meaningful stories to everyone. Our dedication and love for our work remains just as important as ever. We believe that what we do, is a little more important than just being a business, and that is what makes us unique amongst our peers.
